            Among the third generation solar cells, the dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs), also known as the Grätzel cells, have proven to be a promising concept since the publication of the seminal Nature paper in 1991 by Professor Michael Grätzel and his then graduate student Brian O’Regan. The main advantages of DSSCs over other solar cells are the low-cost manufacturing process, the use of abundant and non-toxic titanium dioxide, and the efficient generation of electricity even at diffuse light conditions.

            <b>Abstract:</b> In this work, a simple and a straight-forward approach to derive the parameters of dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) in terms of single diode model is discussed. The parameters are extracted exclusively from single current density–voltage (j–V) curve with some common assumptions. The technique does not require smoothing of the j–V curve by means of polynomial fitting as well as iterative calculation of the diode model equation. The data obtained from this method are compared with that obtained from least square fitting and the combined analyses of electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and j–V data for two different DSSCs. The method is suitable for routine analysis of DSSCs.
